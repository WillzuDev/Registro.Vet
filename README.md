## **About the Project**
  
Register and manage the pet patients of a veterinary clinic.  
The purpose of this project is to create a robust website, from the backend and database to the frontend, and deploy it.  
The creator of the project is [Giuliana Karla](https://www.behance.net/giuxdesigner), she is a UX  and Graphic Designer. I saw her portfolio and realized it would be a great idea to bring the website to life. It is not yet finalized, so over time, new features and screens will be added.
